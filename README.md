**Description of Assignment Features**
For this assignment I was tasked with created 4 different shapes in d3 using HTML svgs. The 4 different shapes were rectangle, polygon, lines, and circles. To achieve this I thought it would be cool to create different items using the 4 shapes. 
For the first item I created using the basic shapes was a postcard. For the actual postcard I used a rectangle. For the additions onto the postcard I used lines and dots to mimic preforations you commonly see on a postcard. I aso added a red square for the stamp. 
For the second item, I created a piece of cheese. For the base I used a yellow triangle. The additions I made to make it actually look like a cheese were a few darker circles as cheese holes and a little curved line for the highlight on the cheese.

**Technical Achievements**

I added a hover feature on the cheese. When you hover, the 'rind' disappears- kind of like if you ate the cheese rind. 

**Design Achievements**

I created concepts out of the shapes which were the postcard and the cheese.

I read through this documentation and used basic concepts to make what I did.
